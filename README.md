# Lens Protocol

- Lens Protocol guarantees the Survival of free and uncensored Expression
- Lens-Protocol allows
  - Ownership of the Data,
  - better Connectivity,
  - Access to more information,
  - a Permission-free Network whose Service cannot be interrupted,
  - and the Absence of a single Entity controlling the Information
- With the Lens Protocol, essential Functions of Social Media are mapped in the Context of Blockchain Technology and enforced through the Use of Smart Contracts
- Lens Protocol is designed to build the decentralized Platform for Social Interactions on the Web3
- It enables the User's Profile and Contacts to be stored in a censorship-resistant Social Graph, with Content being monetized directly via the Blockchain

## Social Graph

- Lens Protocol allows to build Applications using a composable and decentralized Social Graph
- A **Social Graph** is a Diagram that illustrates Interconnections among People, Groups and Organizations in a Social Network

## Smart Contract

- The Smart Contracts of Lens Protocol are deployed to `Polygon`
- User Profiles are represented by NFTs and stored on `Polygon`
- Lens Protocol also provides `Indexer` for their deployed Smart Contracts to query them or send Mutations to them
- `LensHub.sol` is the Entry Point Contract for essentially all Interactions with the Lens Protocol
- `LensHub.sol` is an upgradeable Contract via the Standard OpenZeppelin

## Interaction

## Profile

- Each new Account on Lens Protocol begins with the Creation of an NFT for the Profile it represents
- The **Profile** then allows Users to add Content or connect with others
- When a Connection is made, an NFT-721 Asset is created, which is displayed as the Equivalent of an **Follow NFT**
- Each Profile allows the User to retain full Control over their Content
- All Posts, Comments and Re-Posts (also called Mirrors) are summarized in these Profiles
- In the Lens Protocol ecosystem, all these Actions (like Posts, Comments and Re-Posts) are called **Publications**
- Individual Addresses own these Profile NFTs, whereby an Address can own several such NFTs

### Publication

- **Publication** is understood as all Content produced by Authors, Curators and Users
- In Addition to Content Contributions, this also includes Comments and called **Mirrors**

### Mirror

- Mirrors are similar to Re-Posts or Re-Tweets and serve to share Content
- The mirrored Post is Subject to the Terms of the original Profile

### Comment

- Comments allow Users to add additional Content to another User's Post
- All of a User's Comments are stored in the User's Profile NFT

### Follow

- Users follow each other to follow the Content of the Profiles
- To follow, a **Follow NFT** is created to define the Type and Terms of this Connection with the Profile
- The Profile may set a Fee that the Follower must pay before gaining Access to the Creator's Content
- For Example, a Profile can specify that a Fee of X `MATIC` must be paid in such a Case
- **Follow NFTs** also have a built-in Governance Feature that allows the Profile to easily conduct Polls

### Collect

- Collect is a Method for Authors to monetize their Content
- It allows other Users to mint NFTs of Content published by the original Profile on Terms set by the original Publisher
- It allows Users of the Platform to interact more closely with their Idols

## Advantages of Lens Protocol

- Lens Protocol allows Users to own their Social Graph
- Lens Protocol enables a fair and equal Competition for all Users, so that everyone has a fair Chance to share their Content
- Any Content that a User publishes is freely available on the Blockchain
- This gives all Users an equal Chance to make their Content visible to everyone without an Algorithm restricting or otherwise manipulating the Distribution of Content
